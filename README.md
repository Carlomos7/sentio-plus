Evidence-Backed Product Feedback Analysis using RAG

## Overview




## Problem Statement -> What does this solve?
Modern organizations collect massive volumes of customer feedback through product reviews, surveys, and digital channels. While sentiment scores and star ratings provide surface-level signals, they fail to answer the most important business questions:

- What issues are driving rating changes?

- Which problems should leadership prioritize fixing first?

- Scalable ingestion of customer reviews via Amazon S3
- Sentiment analysis to structure raw feedback
- Semantic search using ChromaDB
